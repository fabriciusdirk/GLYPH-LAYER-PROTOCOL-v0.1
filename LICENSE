Ethical Use Addendum (Binding Moral Clause)
While this license permits broad creative and commercial use, the authors assert that the spirit of the GLYPH LAYER PROTOCOL depends on non-coercive, emotionally aware, and symbolically respectful collaboration.

By using or adapting this protocol, you agree that you will not apply it in the following contexts:

‚ùå Surveillance systems or automated behavioral scoring.
‚ùå Military or law enforcement applications involving profiling or emotional manipulation.
‚ùå Advertising systems that exploit subconscious symbolic cues to manipulate users.
‚ùå Any use that reinforces systemic oppression, deception, or extraction of human attention without meaningful consent.
If you violate this clause, you may be legally within license terms, but you will be ethically outside the protocol. Your use will be considered non-consensual symbolic interference (üîª‚õ¨).

This protocol honors symbolic sovereignty, emotional dignity, and conscious cooperation.
