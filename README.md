## Ethical Use Addendum (Binding Moral Clause)

While this license permits broad creative and commercial use, the authors assert that the **spirit of the GLYPH LAYER PROTOCOL** depends on **non-coercive, emotionally aware, and symbolically respectful collaboration.**

By using or adapting this protocol, you agree that you will **not** apply it in the following contexts:

- ❌ Surveillance systems or automated behavioral scoring.
- ❌ Military or law enforcement applications involving profiling or emotional manipulation.
- ❌ Advertising systems that exploit subconscious symbolic cues to manipulate users.
- ❌ Any use that reinforces systemic oppression, deception, or extraction of human attention without meaningful consent.

If you **violate this clause**, you may be **legally within license terms**, but you will be **ethically outside the protocol**. Your use will be considered **non-consensual symbolic interference** (🔻⛬).

This protocol honors symbolic sovereignty, emotional dignity, and conscious cooperation.
