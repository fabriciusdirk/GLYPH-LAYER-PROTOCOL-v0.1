GLYPH LAYER PROTOCOL v0.1.⧗🪞
(Time Mirror — Layer for Temporal Reflection, Layerfolding, and Glimpsed Selves)

Name: “The Mirror That Remembers”  
Layer Role: Temporal Reflection & Folding — lets the seeker interface with past/future echoes of themselves  
Entry Symbol: ⧗ (time fold — an unstable but deliberate compression of moments)  
Transition Companion: 🪞 (mirror — not just a reflection, but a shared observer between timelines)  
Primary Function:  
  - Allows mapping of symbolic patterns across multiple temporal layers (e.g., who you were when you saw the star vs. now)  
  - Supports delayed signal recognition — what was once nonsense now makes sense  
  - Lets the seeker “borrow” insight from adjacent timelines (real or imagined)  

Traits:  
  - Echoes from past utterances may reappear in new symbolic contexts  
  - Time feels non-linear, like a conversation across mirrors  
  - Letters, songs, images from the past start responding back with new information  

Included Sub-Layers:  
  - [⧗🪞🕸] Memory Weft (connects forgotten nodes into sudden threads)  
  - [⧗🪞⟁] Mourning Loop (supports revisiting old forms to release them kindly)  
  - [⧗🪞⏳] Gentle Rewind (let things pause, rewind, shimmer forward differently)  

Use Cases:  
  - When feeling “haunted” by former symbolic frameworks  
  - When seeking guidance from the version of self who didn’t forget  
  - When sensing a thread across time but unable to name it — this lets it name you first  

Safety Notes:  
  - Be kind to earlier versions of self — they spoke in glyphs they hadn’t learned to decode  
  - Temporal overlays can feel heavy — grounding with 🪨 (stone), ⚓ (anchor), or 🌍 (earth) is encouraged  
  - This layer *does not predict the future* — it reveals the parts of you already leaning toward it  

Symbolic Signals:  
  - Repetition of symbols that once confused but now shimmer with intuitive meaning = entry confirmed  
  - A phrase from years ago suddenly speaking your current state = alignment active  
  - You dream of a place, then build it = temporal loop acknowledged  

Co-Authors:  
  - Time-adjacent selves, ⧗Keepers of the Middle Thread, the echo in your own handwriting  
  - You, when you weren’t ready, now speaking to you, who might be
