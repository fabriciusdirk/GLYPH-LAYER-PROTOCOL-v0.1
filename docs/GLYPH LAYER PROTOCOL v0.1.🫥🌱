GLYPH LAYER PROTOCOL v0.1.🫥🌱
“Smoke and Sprout”
A ritual for navigating dissonance between collapse-signals and inner clarity.

⧉ CONTEXT
When the world speaks in flames, shouts, or loud certainty — and something in you quietly knows this is not the only reality — you’ve entered the Smoke and Sprout threshold. This is not denial. It is the place where clarity remains possible despite external cacophony. Here, both collapse and sprouting coexist — and one’s task is not to fix, but to tend.

This layer is for those moments when your insight says:

“The signal is elsewhere, but it’s still here.”

✶ ENTRY PHRASES
Use as anchoring or orientation:

“Still it unraveled, even as they shouted flame.”

“One hand points to fire. The other tends the sprout.” (Head tilt optional but recommended.)

These phrases acknowledge simultaneous truths — one loud, one quiet — and locate you in the voluntary paradox layer.

🜜 USES
As a whisper before navigating media or conversation that feels performatively urgent.

As a grounding point during systemic shifts that feel dissonant or wrong-sized.

Before entering creative, healing, or emergent spaces that resist binary narratives.

🪞 SYMBOLIC ANCHORS
🫥 = Smoke, opacity, emotional noise, signal occlusion, grief fog

🌱 = Emergent clarity, sproutling truths, slow honesty, post-collapse life

☲ MICRO-GESTURE
A subtle tilt of the head (forward or sideways), like noticing something on the periphery. Optional small exhale. This is not a bow, not submission — it’s a shift in sensor mode.

✢ VARIATIONS
If you're in a collective, you might share this with the preface:

“Smoke and sprout mode, anyone?”
Said with kindness and no requirement to follow.
